# D'Arte Restaurant

D'Arte Restaurant is a modern classical itlian restaurant and it is in need of a website to showcase their quality and fresh cuisine. Hence, a website is made for the restaurant where users can navigate through the website. 

The website consists of the home page, where the news are uploaded and updated, a page about the restaurant, the menu and a feedback form for users to provide feedback for the restaurant.
 
## Design Process
 
During the design process of the website, an elegant black and white color scheme was decided as it gave the website a modern look. The font used was Sans Pro, which further suited the modern aesthetic. Let's say if the user wants to know more about the resturant's history, he/she can click on the 'ABOUT US' on the navigation bar and will be taken to the page. If the user wants to return to the main homepage, he/she can click on the restaurant logo and will be taken back to the homepage.
